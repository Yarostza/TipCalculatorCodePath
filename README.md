My Code Path Submission: Tip Calculator

This is an unfinished version of my calculator app. I have to return the laptop I was provided by the msu iOS Design Lab, and have a personal machine coming in the mail between aug 31st and sep 8th. My hope is to receive that device and then complete this project to a level of which I am excited about before the due date of sep 8th.
