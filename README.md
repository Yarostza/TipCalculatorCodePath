Tip Calculator is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Zachary Yarost

Time spent: 14 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Added a tip splitter, allowing the user to select how many people are splitting the tip. It then reports the total tip and tip per person.
- [x] Added a settings page.
- [x] Added default tip setting that is saved in the settings.
- [x] Added background color theme.
- [x] Added default color theme selector (light/dark/system default) in the settings, which is saved.
- [x] Added app icon.
- [x] Added splash screen on launch.
- [x] Increased size of text and matched font between all pages, including the splash screen, and updated the UI.

## Notes

This project was hugely helpful in getting a basic understanding of how to work with SwiftUI. While it only took an hour to impliment the basic app, I spent a sigificant amount of time understanding the different concepts involved with each additional change I made. I found it extremely enjoyable to work on this application, and it's got me thinking about what I'd like to work on next. Pointedly, I'd really like to dig into UI improvements, and learn about how to implement accesibility features; such as how to best format an app for a screen reader. 

**Reguarding submission date:** I emailed Victoria Angulo reguarding the due date, and was told it would be alright for me to submit my app by this upcoming week of Aug 24th. I am submitting this app today, Aug 23rd. I did not have a machine for a few days, as I had to return a loaned MacBook Pro. I was able to purchase my own MacBook Pro as of the night of Aug 21st, and have spent the weekend working on this project.
